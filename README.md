## Laravel Recipe API

### Introduction
This is a demo of creating a modern RESTful API using Laravel. The purpose is to excercise and showcase my skills and
to serve as a backend for future frontend demo's utilizing my API.
The topic is that of managing recipes and some related entities, it contains endpoints functionality enable:
- managing recipes by users and admins
- managing recipe instructions as aggregate of recipes
- managing recipe ingredients as aggregate of recipes
- browsing these data as anonymous users and being able to filter by e.g. categories
- managing users as admins

Some criteria that have driven the development are as follows:
- differentiated access restrictions for different kinds of users (anonymous, users, admins)
- it should follow a specification for building [json api's](https://jsonapi.org/)
- it should contain tests of its endpoints

The demo is inspired by the excellent [laravel API master class tutorial](https://github.com/laracasts/laravel-api-master-class/) 
by Jeremy McPeak on [laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-api-master-class). 

Thanks for that :-)
